# [Instructions for Presenters](https://indico.cern.ch/event/948465/page/22469-instructions-for-presenters)

We encourage all the speakers to take note of the following guidelines.

## Uploading material

We'll be using Indico to run the meeting.
Please make sure you can find your talk at https://indico.cern.ch/event/948465/contributions and that you have the correct Indico account linked to your presentation.
Check now that you can upload material.

Speakers should upload their presentations to the Indico agenda at 24 hours before their session.
This allows participants to see the slides in advance and allows the session chairs can download the slides (if the speaker has any difficulties in doing this themselves).

## Sessions

The plenary and parallel sessions of vCHEP2021 will take place on Zoom.
The Zoom rooms have been already created by the conference organisers, and the link and passwords will be available in Indico to  registered participants of the conference.
Please upgrade your Zoom client to the latest version.

The sessions will be recorded.
Zoom will inform you that the session is being recorded when you connect to the meeting room.

All chairs and speakers should join the session at least 15 minutes before the start of the session.
Please, test your audio, screen sharing and camera in advance.
If bandwidth allows, we prefer that speakers enable their camera during their talk (not obligatory).

Speakers will screen-share their presentation using the Share Screen function in Zoom while presenting.
When using the Zoom app, click on the green Share Screen button at the bottom center of the Zoom screen. Then select the window that you'd like to share.

We will have some test sessions on May 10-12 to allow speakers to validate their audio/video setup.
We strongly encourage all speakers to attend them, so to ensure that the conference runs smoothly.
See https://indico.cern.ch/event/1036043 for details of these sessions.

## Mattermost channels

There will be a mattermost channel for each session, to allow discussion among participants to the conference.
The mattermost link will be available in the corresponding session description on Indico.
Speakers should connect to the mattermost discussion for their session, which will also allow discussion to carry on after the presentation slot has ended.

## Oral presentations

There will be one single speaker for each presentation, even plenary ones.

All plenary session talks are 22 minutes + questions

All parallel session talks are 8 minutes + questions.

As always, please stay within the allocated time. The session chair will also remind you about the time left.
